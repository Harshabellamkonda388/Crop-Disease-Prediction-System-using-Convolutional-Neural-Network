# ðŸŒ¾ Crop Disease Detection System using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) ðŸ§ 

## Description
This project aims to detect crop diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It leverages deep learning techniques to analyze images of crops and classify them based on whether they are healthy or affected by diseases. By automating disease detection, farmers can take timely action to protect their crops and improve agricultural yield.

## Problem it Solves
The project addresses the challenge of early detection of crop diseases, which is crucial for farmers to prevent widespread damage and ensure better crop management practices. It enables quick and accurate identification of diseased plants, leading to targeted interventions and improved agricultural productivity.

## Use Cases
1. Farmers can upload images of their crops to the system for disease diagnosis.
2. Agricultural experts can use the system for rapid and accurate disease identification during field visits.
3. Researchers can analyze the data collected by the system to study disease patterns and develop new solutions.

## Challenges Faced
1. Acquiring a diverse dataset of crop images with labels for training the CNN model.
2. Fine-tuning the CNN architecture and hyperparameters for optimal performance.
3. Integrating the backend system with the frontend interface for user-friendly interactions.
